# MS4 â€“ Nichetix: The events & tickets platform for your community

![opener]()

[The platform](https://ci-ms4-nichetix.herokuapp.com/) is a Full-Stack-Project which enables a defined niche 
community like regional or special interest (e.g. service providers and retailers in a village or small town; 
craft-beer brewers) to present and sell their offered services/events or find and book a service/event ticket
on a focus-platform for exactly their niche.
The users can focus on their offering/needs and reduce investments in SEO/searching with a well known 
niche-platform for their interests.

## UX

### Strategy & Scope

#### Host of events...
- have a platform for my specific customers (e.g. a regional/local or special-interest customer group)

- open events with information
- provide location information to my guests

- sell tickets
- define different ticket types 
   - prices, discounted, slotted...

- check in guests
- open a communication channel to guests, if information changes
- monitor my sales

- MENTION WHY ITS OKAY TO HAVE A EVENT WITHOUT TICKETS (e.g. advertising for a fair with free entry)
- MENTION WHY EVENTS AND LOCATION IN SAME APP (an event without a location is not useful for hosts and guests)

#### Buyer of tickets...
- have a platform for my specific customers (e.g. a regional/local or special-interest customer group)

- buy tickets
- find events
- research on events
- logged-in: store and present tickets

#### Niche ticket provider...
- sell tickets
- monitor sales
- get a share for providing the platform
